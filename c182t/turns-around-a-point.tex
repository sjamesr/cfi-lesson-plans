\section{Turns Around a Point}

\subsection{Description}

A maneuver requiring a constant radius turn about a point on the ground.

\subsection{Objective}

To teach turning technique, subconscious control of the airplane, division of
attention, effects of bank angle to radius of a turn, perception of altitude
and correction of wind drift.

\subsection{Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area
  \item Configure aircraft: flaps up, maneuvering speed $\leq V_A$
    (C182T: 18'' Hg, 2300 RPM, approx. 110 KIAS), straight-and-level at
    altitude between 600-1000' AGL, trim to maintain altitude
  \item Select outside reference (a distinguished point to encircle)
  \item Enter the circle, ideally on downwind and close enough to allow for a
    30$^\circ$ to 45$^\circ$ bank at steepest point (this lesson assumes
    downwind entry)
  \item Turn to the steepest bank at the start of the circle (on downwind)
  \item Upon rounding the turn, the bank will become progressively shallower
    until on upwind, at which point it will be shallowest, then start to become
    steeper again until again on downwind
  \item Maintain radius of circle by adjusting bank as necessary to compensate
    for wind
  \item Maintain ball centered
  \item Look for traffic throughout
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Failure to adequately clear the area
  \item Failure to establish appropriate bank on entry
  \item Failure to recognize wind drift
  \item Excessive bank and/or inadequate wind correction angle on the downwind
    side of the circle resulting in drift towards the reference point
  \item Inadequate bank angle and/or excessive wind correction angle on the
    upwind side of the circle resulting in drift away from the reference point
  \item Skidding turns when turning from downwind to crosswind
  \item Slipping turns when turning from upwind to crosswind
  \item Gaining or losing altitude
  \item Inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft
  \item Inability to direct attention outside the airplane while maintaining
    precise airplane control
\end{itemize}
