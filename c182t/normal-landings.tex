\section{Normal Landings}

\subsection{Description}

Approach and landing with headwind or light wind, hard surface of sufficient
length and no obstructions.

\subsection{Objective}

To teach techniques necessary for a normal landing.

\subsection{Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area (should be runway)
  \item Configure aircraft for pattern entry (C182T: 16'' Hg, 2400 RPM, 100
    KIAS) 
  \item Select outside references (e.g. runway numbers)
  \item Enter downwind, maintaining traffic pattern altitude (typically 1000'
    AGL) 
  \item Configure aircraft for approach: GUMPFS check: Gas (fuel to both),
    Undercarriage (gear down and welded), Mixture (full rich), Propeller (full
    RPM), Flaps, Switches (lights as necessary)
  \item Abeam touchdown point, power and pitch for approach (C182T: 14.5'' Hg, 95
    KIAS)
  \item First notch of flaps (C182T: 10$^\circ$)
  \item Coordinated turn to base ($\leq 30^\circ$ bank), when reference point
    is 45$^\circ$ behind the wing
  \item On base: second notch of flaps, begin to slow for final (C182T:
    20$^\circ$, 85 KIAS)
  \item Clear area, then turn to final ($\leq 30^\circ$ bank)
  \item On final: remaining flaps (C182T: 30$^\circ$) when runway is assured,
    GUMPFS check
  \item Select aim point (e.g. before runway numbers)
  \item Adjust pitch and power to maintain normal approach speed and descent
    angle (C182T: 70 KIAS)
  \item Trim to relieve control pressures
  \item Make sure feet are not on brakes
  \item 10-20' off ground: reduce throttle to idle
  \item Gradually apply back pressure to pitch for landing attitude, attempting
    to fly just above runway (fly in ground effect) straight-and-level until
    passing aim point, then continue adjusting pitch for climb attitude just
    above horizon
  \item Touchdown on main gear just above stalling speed
  \item Maintain pitch attitude for aerodynamic braking
  \item Gradually relax back pressure to lower nose wheel
  \item Gentle braking as required
\end{itemize}

Include a discussion on performance charts and other landing scenarios. Keep
one hand on throttle.

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Inadequate wind drift correction on the base leg
  \item Overshooting or undershooting the turn onto final approach resulting in
    too steep or too shallow a turn onto final approach
  \item Flat or skidding turns from base leg to final approach as a result of
    overshooting/inadequate wind drift correction
  \item Poor coordination during turn from base to final approach
  \item Failure to complete the landing checklist in a timely manner
  \item Unstabilized approach
  \item Failure to adequately compensate for flap extension
  \item Poor trim technique on final approach
  \item Attempting to maintain altitude or reach the runway using elevator
    alone
  \item Focusing too close to the airplane resulting in a too high roundout
  \item Focusing too far from the airplane resulting in a too low roundout
  \item Touching down prior to attaining proper landing attitude
  \item Failure to hold sufficient back-elevator pressure after touchdown
  \item Excessive braking after touchdown
\end{itemize}
