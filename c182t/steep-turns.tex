\section{Steep Turns}

\subsection{Description}

A maneuver consisting of a turn in either direction using a bank angle between
45$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$.

\subsection{Objectives}

To develop the smoothness, coordination, orientation, division of attention,
and control techniques necessary for the execution of maximum performance turns
when the airplane is near its performance limits.

\subsection{Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area
  \item Configure aircraft: straight-and-level, airspeed less than $V_A$
    (C182T: 18'' Hg, 2300 RPM, 110 KIAS at MGW), altitude $\geq 1600'$ AGL 
  \item Select outside references
  \item Establish bank between 45$^\circ$ â€“ 50$^\circ$ and simultaneously apply
    back elevator pressure and add power (C182T: trim up 2 half-turns and 20''
    Hg, 2300 RPM) to maintain altitude $\pm 100'$ (stay above 1500' AGL)
    (50$^\circ$ for commercial maneuvers, 45$^\circ$ for private maneuvers)
  \item Trim as needed
  \item Keep ball centered
  \item Use external references: horizon for bank while also looking for
    traffic
  \item Anticipate roll-out by leading approx. 20$^\circ$ (half bank angle) to
    original heading $\pm 10^\circ$
  \item Upon completion of 360$^\circ$ turn (usually left), complete a second
    360$^\circ$ to the opposite direction (usually right); a perfect turn will
    end with slight turbulence as you hit your own wake
  \item Adjust pitch, power, trim as necessary
  \item Maintain ball centered 
  \item Look for traffic
\end{itemize}

In side-by-side airplanes, pilots on the left seat tend to dive on turns to the
left because the nose appears to rise when making a left turn, and vice versa.
This is known as parallax error.

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Failure to clear area
  \item Excessive pitch change during entry or recovery
  \item Starting recovery prematurely
  \item Failure to stop the turn on a precise heading
  \item Excessive rudder during recovery, resulting in skidding
  \item Inadequate power management
  \item Poor coordination
  \item Failure to maintain a constant altitude
  \item Failure to maintain a constant bank angle
  \item Disorientation
  \item Attempting to perform maneuver by instrument reference instead of
    visual
  \item Failure to scan for traffic during the maneuver
\end{itemize}
