\section{Slow Flight}

\subsection{Description}

Level flight, turns, climbs, and descents performed in various configurations
at the minimum controllable airspeed.

\subsection{Objective}

To teach planning, orientation, division of attention and control feel during
slow flight.

\subsection{Setup}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area 
  \item Configure aircraft: $\geq 1500'$ AGL, cowl flaps open, full flaps,
    power and pitch for 1.3 $V_{S_0}$ (C182T: 15'' Hg, 2400 RPM, 55 KIAS)
  \item Select outside references 
  \item Adjust pitch and power to maintain airspeed and altitude 
  \item Fly straight-and-level, coordinated standard rate turns, climbs and
    descents in slow flight
  \item Maintain ball centered
  \item Look for traffic
\end{itemize}

\section{Recovery}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Smoothly advance power to full
  \item Retract one notch of flaps (C182T: 20$^\circ$)
  \item Upon positive rate of climb, retract second notch of flaps
  \item Flaps 0$^\circ$
  \item Cowl flaps closed
  \item Look for traffic
\end{itemize}

Controllability and maneuverability:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Flight controls are less effective due to reduced airflow; more control
    pressure is required
  \item In the back side of the power curve: pitch for airspeed, power for
    altitude
  \item Torque effect is very prominent
  \item High gross weight and forward CG increase stall speed
  \item Increase the bank angle, load factor and stall speed increase
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Failure to establish specified flap configuration
  \item Improper entry technique
  \item Failure to establish and maintain the specified airspeed
  \item Excessive variations of altitude and heading when a constant altitude
    and heading are specified
  \item Rough or uncoordinated control technique
  \item Improper correction for torque effect
  \item Improper trim technique
  \item Unintentional stalls
  \item Inappropriate removal of hand from throttles
\end{itemize}
