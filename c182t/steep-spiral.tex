\section{Steep Spiral}

\subsection{Description}

A maximum performance maneuver that combines a steep-spiraling descent with the
basic elements of turns about a point.

\subsection{Objective}

To develop pilot techniques for airspeed control, wind drift control, planning,
orientation, and division of attention, with practical application for
emergency landings.

\subsection{Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area (ideally adjacent to encircling point) \item
    Configure aircraft: straight-and-level, altitude sufficient to allow three
    complete turns and still be $\geq 1500'$ AGL, (C182T: 6000' AGL minimum),
    GUMPFS (propeller to full), flaps 0$^\circ$ 
  \item Select outside references (point to encircle, ideally adjacent to a
    forced landing area)
  \item Throttle to idle, propeller to full 
  \item Establish best glide speed (C182T: 76 KIAS 0$^\circ$ flaps)
  \item Establish a constant radius circle allowing a bank of $\leq 60^\circ$
    about ground reference point 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Close enough to allow no more than 60$^\circ$ of bank at the steepest point
    \end{itemize}
  \item Maintaining a constant airspeed by adjusting pitch and bank as
    necessary to correct for wind 
  \item Trim as necessary
  \item Clear the engine when into the wind (advance throttle to normal cruise
    momentarily)
  \item Complete at least three complete 360$^\circ$ turns, but do not descend below
    1500' AGL unless the maneuver is to be followed by an emergency landing
  \item Maintain ball centered
  \item Look for traffic
\end{itemize}

Objective with a 60$^\circ$ bank is to get down fast (high bank eliminates lift
component) safely.

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Failure to clear area
  \item Failure to maintain constant airspeed
  \item Poor coordination, resulting in skidding and/or slipping
  \item Inadequate wind drift correction
  \item Failure to coordinate the controls so that no increase/decrease in
    speed result when straight glide is resumed
  \item Failure to scan for other traffic
  \item Failure to maintain orientation
\end{itemize}
