\section{S-Turns Across a Road}

\subsection{Description}

A practice maneuver in which the airplane's ground track describes semicircle
of equal radii on each side of a selected straight line on the ground.

\subsection{Objective}

To teach the ability to compensate for drift during turns, orient the flight
path with ground references, follow an assigned ground track, arrive at
specified points on assigned headings, and divide the pilot's attention.

\subsection{Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area 
  \item Configure aircraft: flaps up, maneuvering speed $\leq V_A$
    (C182T: 18'' Hg, 2300 RPM, approx. 110 KIAS), straight-and-level at
    altitude between 600-1000' AGL, trim to maintain altitude
  \item Select a straight ground reference perpendicular to the wind
  \item Approach ground reference from upwind side (have a tailwind)
  \item Start first turn to the left (steepest bank) upon crossing the ground
    reference
  \item When aircraft is parallel to ground reference the aircraft should have
    a moderate bank and groundspeed is decreasing
  \item Approaching the reference point again the aircraft should have its
    shallowest bank
  \item A proper maneuver will result in wings level and parallel to the
    reference upon crossing
  \item Start second turn to the right (shallowest bank) upon crossing the
    ground reference
  \item When aircraft is parallel to ground reference the aircraft should have
    a moderate bank with groundspeed increasing
  \item Approaching the reference point again the aircraft should have its
    steepest bank
  \item At completion of the maneuver, wings should be level and parallel to
    the reference upon crossing
  \item Maintain ball centered
  \item Look for traffic
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Failure to adequately clear the area
  \item Poor coordination
  \item Gaining or losing altitude
  \item Inability to visualize the half circle ground track
  \item Poor timing in beginning and recovering from turns
  \item Faulty correction for drift
  \item Inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft
\end{itemize}
