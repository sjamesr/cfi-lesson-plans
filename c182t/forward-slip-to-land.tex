\section{Forward Slip to a Landing}

\subsection{Description}

An intentionally uncoordinated maneuver when the bank angle of an airplane is
too steep for the existing rate of turn but the ground track is kept parallel
to the runway. Useful in forced landings and steep approaches for landing in
confined areas.

\subsection{Objective}

To teach judgment and procedures necessary to descend rapidly while maintaining
control and ground track to allow for a safe landing.

\subsection{Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area (runway)
  \item Configure aircraft: landing checklist (full flaps), final
    approach (C182T: 14.5'' Hg, 2400 RPM, 70 KIAS)
  \item Select outside references (touchdown point)
  \item Throttle to idle, flaps full, bank in the direction of any crosswind
    with sufficient bank to give a steep descent based on the altitude
    necessary to lose while simultaneously applying sufficient opposite rudder
    to maintain the original flightpath
  \item Pitch nose down
  \item Recover when a normal landing can be made: level the wings while
    releasing rudder
  \item Pitch to normal glide attitude
  \item Land at touchdown point beyond and within 400â€™
    at approximate stalling speed with no side drift
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Recovering by abruptly releasing rudder pressure, causing the nose to
    swing to quickly and causing excessive airspeed
  \item Failing to control pitch resulting in excessive or insufficient airspeed
  \item Side slipping, resulting in drifting away from the ground track to the
    centerline of the runway
\end{itemize}
