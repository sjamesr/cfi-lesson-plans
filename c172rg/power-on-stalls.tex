\section{Power-On Stalls}

\subsection{Description}

A rapid degeneration of lift as a result of excessive angle of attack, entered
from takeoff and climb configuration.

\subsection{Objective}

To teach recognition and recovery from a full stall under take-off conditions
and required recovery action.

\subsection{Setup}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear the area
  \item Choose forced landing area
  \item Configure aircraft for just before take-off: gear down, no flaps,
    carburetor heat on, slow to normal take-off speed with max propeller RPM
    (C172RG: 15'' Hg, 2700 RPM, 65 KIAS), altitude so recovery is $\geq 1500'$
    AGL
  \item Select outside references
  \item Throttle to full (carburetor heat off) while simultaneously applying
    back-elevator pressure to smoothly raise nose to a high pitch attitude
  \item Maintain back-elevator pressure at its full limit until airspeed,
    bleeding airspeed until it falls beyond VS1 (C172RG: 50 KIAS) and stalls
  \item Maintain coordination (ball centered) and neutral ailerons
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recovery}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduce the angle of attack by releasing back-elevator pressure
  \item Simultaneously increasing throttle to full (if not already)
  \item Anticipate left-turning tendencies with right rudder pressure
  \item Return nose to straight-and-level coordinated flight 
  \item Maintain ball centered
  \item Upon positive rate of climb, retract flaps and gear as necessary 
  \item Look for traffic
\end{itemize}

Practice both straight-and-level and turning stalls (up to 20$^\circ$).
Indicators: speed, buffeting and stall horn.

\subsection{Common Errors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Failure to adequately clear the area
  \item Inability to recognize an approaching stall condition through feel for
    the airplane
  \item Premature recovery
  \item Over-reliance on the airspeed indicator while excluding other cues
  \item Inadequate scanning resulting in an unintentional wing-low condition
    during entry
  \item Excessive back-elevator pressure resulting in an exaggerated nose-up
    attitude during entry
  \item Inadequate rudder control
  \item Inadvertent secondary stall during recovery
  \item Failure to maintain a constant bank angle during turning stalls
  \item Excessive forward-elevator pressure during recovery resulting in
    negative load on the wings
  \item Excessive airspeed buildup during recovery
  \item Failure to take timely action to prevent a full stall during the
    conduct of imminent stalls
\end{itemize}
