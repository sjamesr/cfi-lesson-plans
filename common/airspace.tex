\section{Airspace}

\subsection{Objective}

To familiarize the student with the types and purpose of the various airspace
designations in the National Airspace System (NAS).

\subsection{Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Class A,B,C,D,E,G
  \item Special-Use Airspace
  \item Other airspace
  \item Special VFR
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equipment}

Sectional and/or Terminal Charts.

\subsection{Schedule}

Discussion (40 minutes).

\subsection{Instructor Actions}

%% TODO(sjr): include the airspace diagram from the IFH
Discuss each of the controlled airspaces A-E, and G, and their visibility and
cloud requirements, entry and equipment requirements, etc. (Refer to
FAA-H-8083-15A Instrument Flying Handbook Fig. 8-1).

Airspace speed limits (14 CFR 91.117)
\begin{itemize}
  \item Class B--surface to 10,000' MSL, max speed 250 kts (200 kts underlying)
  \item Class C--surface to 4000' AGL, max speed 200 kts within 4nm, 2500 AGL
  \item Class D--surface to 2500' AGL, max speed 200 kts
  \item Otherwise, no civil aircraft may operate greater than Mach 1 (14 CFR
    91.817)
\end{itemize}

Special Use Airspace (AIM 3-4-1)
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prohibited areas--flight not permitted
  \item Restricted areas--flight subject to restrictions (artillery, aerial
    gunnery, etc.), permission required
  \item Warning areas--3nm beyond coast, similar to restricted, but no
    permission required
  \item Military Operation Area (MOA)--military training activities, a military
    version of ``warning areas''
  \item Alert areas--ok to enter, high volume of activity (pilot training,
    unusual aerial activity)
  \item Controlled Firing Areas (CFA)--not charted, activities are suspended if
    aircraft approach, no permission required
\end{itemize}

Other Airspace Areas (AIM 3-5-1)
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mode C veil around Class B airspace
  \item MTR--military training route; military aircraft $>$ 250 kts; 4 digits $<$
    1500AGL
  \item TFR--temporary flight restriction
  \item Parachute jump operations
  \item Published VFR routes
  \item VFR flyways--back of TAC chart
  \item VFR corridors--(e.g. Los Angeles Special Flight Rules)
  \item Class B VFR transition routes--(e.g. San Diego, mini route, Hollywood
    Park route)
  \item TRSA--(e.g. Palm Springs); participation is voluntary but recommended
    (AIM 4-1-17)
  \item National Security Areas--requested not to fly through; flight may be
    prohibited at certain times, check NOTAMs
\end{itemize}

Special VFR (14 CFR 91.157, AIM 4-4-6)
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1sm visibility, clear of clouds
  \item At night, must have an instrument rating and IFR-equipped aircraft
  \item Must ask for it, ATC cannot offer
  \item Not allowed at some airports--see sectional or terminal chart
\end{itemize}

Marginal VFR (not a clearance)
\begin{itemize}
  \item Visibility between 3-5 statute miles and/or ceiling between 1000-3000' AGL
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation}

Lesson is complete when student can demonstrate understanding of the various
airspaces in the National Airspace System.
